                            in the past i felt like i need to have a full time job to make money and support my family.
                            but now i feel like i can make money by doing what i love.
                            i'm not saying that you need to quit your job to become a indie maker.
                            but you need to find a way to make money while doing what you love.
                            so how to do that?
                            first, you need to find a problem that you want to solve.
                            second, you need to find a solution to that problem.
                            third, you need to build a product that solves that problem.
                            fourth, you need to market your product.
                            fifth, you need to sell your product.
                            sixth, you need to repeat the process.

                        <Text mb={6}>
                            now when i code meaningful applications that help people to make their life easier,
                            i feel like i'm doing what i love.
                            also my inner voice is quiet now and i'm more focused on my goals.
                            it's like a magic, you will feel like you're on the right path.
                            i'm not saying that it's easy, but it's worth it.
                            i also feel like i'm more productive now, i have more energy and i'm more motivated.
                            also the entrepreneur mindset is absolutely something that i'm interested in.
                            so indie maker is a perfect fit for me.

                            building in public allows you to get feedback from your audience.
